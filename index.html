      <p>Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Economics Department at Boston University. I am a quantitative macroeconomist with research interests in labor markets, technological change, and the economics of gender and the family.  </p>
      <p>My current research explores a particular microeconomic source of gender gaps in the labor market in terms of differences in job search behavior. </p>
      <p>Recently, I was a Dissertation Fellow at the Boston Federal Reserve. Before starting graduate school, I worked at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., and the U.N. World Food Programme in Dakar, Senegal. </p>
