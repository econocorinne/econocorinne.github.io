      <h2>Mentorship Experience</h2>       

      <p>I take the role and responsibility of mentorship seriously. As a graduate student, I served as co-Chair of the <a href="https://www.bostonugwe.com/" class="weorg-link" target="_blank">BU Women & Nonbinary People in Economics</a> at Boston University. You can read more about the genesis and evolution of the organization <a href="https://www.bostonugwe.com/" class="weorg-link" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

      <h3>Activities</h3>         
        <p><strong>1. Student-Faculty Mentorship Program</strong></p>
        <p> Faculty are matched to a small group of students and meet regularly throughout the year. The goal is to give identifying women and underrepresented students an opportunity to receive professional guidance and feedback on navigating graduate school and the job market. </p>
        <p><strong>2. Presentation Workshops for Job Market Candidates</strong></p>
        <p> We host workshops for identifying women to present their job market paper to faculty outside their field.  </p>
         <p><strong>3. Distinguished Speaker Series</strong></p>
        <p> Each year we invite a distinguished economist from an underrepresented group to spend a day at BU. Their visit consists of research seminar and presentation highlighting their personal trajectory into economics. Past speakers have included: Tavneet Suri (2024), Lisa Barrow (2023), Leah Boustan (2021), and Sandra Black (2020). </p>
        <p><strong>4. Gender Economics Reading Group</strong></p>
        <p> Students and faculty discuss recent papers in the field and present research in progress in bimonthly meetings. </p>
        <p><strong>5. Applying to Graduate School Panel</strong></p>
        <p> We organize panels for undergraduate students to demystify the process of applying to graduate school. </p>
        <p><strong>6. Conferences</strong></p>
        <p> In 2019, we hosted a conference entitled <a href="https://questromworld.bu.edu/weorg/" class="weorg-link" target="_blank">Women in Economics: Research, Ideas, Solutions, Executions (WERISE)</a>. We plan to host a second edition of the conference in Fall 2025 with support from the Boston Federal Reserve. </p>
